    <h1>Epic Fantasies of Harry Potter</h1>
    <h2>The Adventures and Charisma of the main characters</h2>

    <p>Harry Potter is the most miserable, lonely boy you can imagine. He’s shunned by his relatives, the Dursleys, who have raised him since he was an infant. 
    He’s forced to live in the cupboard under the stairs, forced to wear his cousin Dudley’s hand-me-down clothes, and forced to go to his neighbour’s house when the rest of the family is doing something fun. Yes, he’s just about as miserable as you can get. </p>
    <p>Harry’s world gets turned upside down on his 11th birthday, however. 
    A magical half-giant, Hagrid, informs Harry that he’s really a wizard, and will soon be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry also learns that, in the wizarding world, he’s a hero. When he was an infant, the evil Lord Voldemort killed his parents and then tried to kill Harry too. What’s so amazing to everyone is that Harry survived, and allegedly destroyed Voldemort in the process.</p>
